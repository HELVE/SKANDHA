skandha
Cinematic Game

Game based on motion-camera recorded scenes turned into a virtual pixelated environment. Shapes of objects. Directed like a TV series. First filmed, then turned into a game. 

Skandhas (Sanskrit) or khandhas (Pāḷi) means "heaps, aggregates, collections, groupings".[1] In Buddhism, it refers to the five aggregates concept that asserts five factors constitute and completely explain a sentient being’s mental and physical existence[2][3][4]. The five aggregates or heaps are: form (or matter or body) (rupa), sensations (or feelings, received from form) (vedana), perceptions (samjna), mental activity or formations (sankhara), and consciousness (vijnana).[5][6][7]

The skandhas refute the idea of a "being or individual", and complements the anatta doctrine of Buddhism which asserts that all things and beings are without self.[3][8][9] The anatta and "five aggregates" doctrines are part of the liberating knowledge in Buddhism, wherein one realizes that there is no-self, as the "being" is merely made up of a temporary grouping of five aggregates, each of which are "not I, and not my self", and each of the skandha is empty, without substance.[10][11]

In the Theravada tradition, suffering arises when one identifies with or clings to the aggregates. This suffering is extinguished by relinquishing attachments to aggregates. The Mahayana tradition asserts that the nature of all aggregates as intrinsically empty of independent existence. The use of the skandhas concept to explain the self is a concept unique to Buddhism among major Indian religions. It is not shared by Hinduism and Jainism, which believe that a living being has an eternal soul or metaphysical self.[12][13]
